# Templated Linked List

This implementation of a doubly linked list allows for storage and access of any data type, even user-created data types!

## Details

The implementation uses dynamic memory to allocate space for every node in the list, where each node contains the data to be stored, as well as pointers to the node before and after it. As such with dynamic memory, the Big Three functions were used to avoid memory leaks: Copy Constructor, Copy Assignment Operator, and Destructor.
